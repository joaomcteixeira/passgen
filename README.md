An utterly simple password generator made in Python.

By default, a password contains lower and upper case characters, digits,
and punctuation. You can disable these different types separately.

**Usage:**

```bash
    python passgen.py -h
    python passgen.py
    python passgen.py -pu
```

**Example:**

```bash
$ python passgen.py 
eTJ1s.n_p,JBRVn?
```

```bash
$ python passgen.py -pu -l 10
6T0dHq2djO
```
